Bootcamp Pandas Challenge 
The Pandas script PyCitySchools_main.ipynb was developed as a homework assignment to analyze fictional school district data regarding overall school stats and their standardized reading and math scores. The script imports two csv files located in the Resources folder, then combines the two datasets based on the names of the schools in the district. The script analyzes the size and spend of each school, as well as the scores and passing rates of the standardizes tests.

I used the provided PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file located in the Resources folder as a guide for the style and structure of my script. In addition, there were blocks of code provided in the starter file for use in the Pandas assignment.

The code to determine whether the schools were designated as District or Charter was provided by the U-Penn Bootcamp class instructor, Reed Hyde.

The use of brackets, braces, and parenthesis in datasets was discussed in our class study group on Wednesday, July 26, 2023 with myself, Liz DiScala, and Crystal Lucas.
